# Door-Lock-Security-System

The objective of this project was to design and implement a secure door lock security system using multiple authentication factors. In this modern age, physical keys provide security risks such as loss, theft, and duplication. For a better and more secure system, we have addressed these limitations by using RFID technology combined with keypad authentication to provide a low-cost and reliable automated door lock system. 
	
The system requires the user to first scan the registered RFID card and then enter a secure PIN on the keypad so that the door lock servo can be released which ultimately opens the door. The system provides LCD feedback, audible buzzer responses, and logged access attempts to the EEPROM. The implementation of this project illustrates concepts such as PWM control, SPI communication, timers, interrupts, and persistent storage which were all taught and covered in the course.
